    "If checking program equivalence is so important, you might be thinking, can we write another program that automatically does it for us? The answer is yes and no. We'll study some simple types of computers, and for the first of these (which are equivalent to regular expressions), we can indeed automatically check equivalence. But as we move to more complex types of computers, things change. In general, there is no such thing as a program that can check the equivalence of other programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most complex type of computer we'll study is still quite rudimentary. A Turing machine has a head that moves left and right on a tape and follows instructions of the form \"if the current symbol is $a$, then write $b$, move left/right, and goto $r$\". Turing machines have been constructed out of [wood] or [Legos], and it's possible to [compile C] code into Turing machines. But primarily, they exist only in theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason they are important is that, as we will show, _any_ current digital computer (under some reasonable assumptions) can be emulated by a Turing machine; we will further argue that even computers of the future can be emulated by Turing machines. Thus, Turing machines serve as a definition of what a computer is. If something can be done on a computer, it can be done on a Turing machine; if something cannot be done on a Turing machine, it cannot be done on any other computer.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's not too hard to show that the example functions above are equivalent (for nonnegative integers $n$), but are there examples that would stump even the smartest people? In fact, Turing machines were invented as an answer to a very similar question. Turing introduced them in 1936, years before the first computer was built, to formalize what it means for _humans_ to compute (for example, to do arithmetic or to write a formal proof). He proposed some assumptions about how a human (with pencil, eraser, and paper) computes, and showed that everything he or she does could be emulated by a Turing machine (a proposition now known as the Church-Turing Thesis). The implication is that there are pairs of programs out there whose equivalence or nonequivalence humans will never be able to prove.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people (especially computer scientists) take this thesis further, saying that all human thinking is computation and can therefore be emulated by a Turing machine, or any other computer with sufficient memory. Some people take the thesis much further and say that the universe can be simulated by, or even is, a computer. In order to understand and interact with such ideas, you need to understand theory of computing. So, the theory of computing is a point of contact between computer science and other fields like mathematics, physics, philosophy, and even theology. If you've wondered what your core courses have to do with computer science, I hope you'll see some connections here."

    "In this course we want to study all the things that a computer can do. That seems very diverse, and it would seem that we have to study many different kinds of computations separately. But maybe we can reduce them all to one kind of problem, and focus our study on that one kind of problem. And we claim that any computational problem can be reduced to problems of the form: Does string $w$ belong to language $L$?\n",
    "\n",
    "People are fairly comfortable these days with the idea that any kind of object we might want to compute about can be represented as a string. We deal every day with messages, music, pictures, movies, books, etc., in digital form, with the awareness that these are just strings of 0’s and 1’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less obvious, perhaps, is that it makes sense to reduce all kinds of computations down to questions about whether strings belong to languages. First of all, our experience with computers today is highly interactive. But user-computer interaction can be thought of as a sequence of inputs and outputs. Second, the output from a computer is much more than just a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. But if you have any function $f(x)$ that takes an input $x$ and outputs another string, we can think of it as the related function $f'(x,y)$ that takes an input $x$ and a possible output $y$, and returns \"yes\" iff $f(x) = y$.\n",

    "It might be helpful to compare this notation for strings with C++. A symbol is a `char`. Just like a constant `'a'` and a variable `a` are not the same in C++, so in math, the symbol $\\mathtt{a}$ and the variable $a$ are not the same. A string is a C++ `string`. In C++, the constants `'a'` and `\"a\"` are different; in math (and in Python), they are identical. In C++, the empty string is `\"\"`; in math, $\\varepsilon$. In C++, you concatenate strings with `v+w`; in math, we write $v\\circ w$ or $vw$.\n",
