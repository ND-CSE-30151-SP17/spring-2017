    "Section 4.1 is long. It shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular, context-free, decidable, and Turing-recognizable languages form a hierarchy (Figure 4.10).\n",
    "- Some results about regular and context-free languages that are interesting in their own right, like the fact that you can test whether two DFAs are equivalent. (We used this fact to partially automate the grading of one exam question.)\n",
    "- A more subtle point is that _a priori_ we might think that some context-free languages are not decidable. For a PDA can have a computation branch that goes on forever. But in fact, it's possible to simulate the PDA so that infinite computation branches can be detected and cut short.\n",

    "### The universal Turing machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus for today is the universal TM $U$ defined at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 4.11. It is a TM that can read in the description of another TM and simulate it. For some reason, the book deemphasizes this idea. It's significant not only because of its relevance to Theorem 4.11, but also because it gave rise to (or at least anticipated) the idea of a stored program computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to show how to encode a TM as a string. This is easy to do and the details are not important, but it's worth at least mentioning one way to do it for concreteness. Turing's original encoding used an alphabet $\\{\\mathtt{A}, \\mathtt{C}, \\mathtt{D}, \\mathtt{L}, \\mathtt{R}, \\mathtt{N}\\}$. If the states in $Q$ are numbered $q_1, q_2, \\ldots$, then state $q_i$ is encoded as $\\mathtt{DA}^i$. If the symbols in $\\Gamma$ are numbered $a_0, a_1, \\ldots$, where $a_0$ is the blank symbol, then symbol $a_i$ is encoded as $\\mathtt{DC}^i$. Then, the transition $\\delta(q_i, a_j) = (q_k, a_\\ell, \\textrm{L})$ is encoded as $\\mathtt{DA}^i \\mathtt{DC}^j \\mathtt{DC}^\\ell \\mathtt{L} \\mathtt{DA}^k$, and similarly if the move is R or N. We also need some convention for indicating the start, accept, and reject states: perhaps $q_1$ is always the start state, $q_2$ the accept state, and $q_3$ the reject state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we have to show the universal TM itself. It is often constructed as a TM with three tapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An encoding of $M$, the machine being simulated.\n",
    "2. The tape of $M$.\n",
    "3. The state of $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation-level description would be: On input $\\langle M, w\\rangle$, where $M$ is a TM and $w$ is a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy $M$ onto tape 1 and $w$ onto tape 2.\n",
    "2. Initialize tape 3 to the start state of $M$.\n",
    "3. Repeat:\n",
    "   1. If the state (tape 3) is the accept state, _accept_; if it is the reject state, _reject_.\n",
    "   2. Search on tape 1 for an instruction that matches the current state (encoded on tape 3) and current input symbol (encoded on tape 2).\n",
    "   3. Write the new state to tape 3 and the new symbol to tape 2.\n",
    "   4. Move the head on tape 2 to the left or right as indicated by the instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellany\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a cottage industry of seeing who can make the smallest universal TM. The [current record holder](http://alvyray.com/CreativeCommons/BizCardUniversalTuringMachine_v2.2.pdf), due to Rogozhin, has only a couple dozen instructions."
